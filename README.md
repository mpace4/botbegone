final project python 1

Team Thin Crust Pizza
Project - BotBeGone
Members: Mike Pace, Yitian Huang, Jeremiah Cabanos

Status:
We have most of our functions working properly, with a gui for the user to interact with our program.
We still need to add a couple more functions that process specific data from the twitter account
to better identify the users. A final thing we can do is calibrate our point system to evenly
attribute towards the likelyhood of a user being a bot and in our ouput to add what qualities
of that users profile raised flags as being bot like.
