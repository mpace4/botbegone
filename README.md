# botbegone

A python application utilizing the Twitter API to pull and analyze a Twitter user's information to determine if that user is a bot.
Our algorithm analyzes a users tweets (Time of tweets, number of RTs to total tweets, contents of tweet), bio, profile picture, and date created
to determine the chances that a user is a bot. We integrated the tkinter library for our GUI.
