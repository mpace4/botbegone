Updated Status:
We've added the rest of our functions such as the tweet time checker which checks if the user tweets
at a periodcal time like every hour or same time each day. Another function we added was the rt checker
which compares the number of retweets to the users own tweets from the tweets pulled. As for our GUI,
we've cleaned up our interface for the user. It is more concise and when it displays the results it
gives a clear indication as to which functions it acquired points from and gives the total given points 
out of the total possible points. We also added a blue bird icon to better indicate it is twitter related.

Status:
We have most of our functions working properly, with a gui for the user to interact with our program.
We still need to add a couple more functions that process specific data from the twitter account
to better identify the users. A final thing we can do is calibrate our point system to evenly
attribute towards the likelyhood of a user being a bot and in our ouput to add what qualities
of that users profile raised flags as being bot like.
